# Pseudo-Code-Template-
This pseudo code outlines a basic feedback form mechanism, which includes input validation and conditional operations based on the content of the feedback.
BEGIN
   DISPLAY "User Feedback Form"
   INPUT: Enter user name in "Name Field"
   INPUT: Enter feedback in "Feedback Field"
   VERIFY: Ensure both fields are not empty
   IF both fields are not empty
       THEN
           SAVE feedback to database
           DISPLAY "Thank you for your feedback!"
           IF feedback contains urgent keywords like 'error', 'fail', 'not working'
               THEN send email notification to support team
           ENDIF
       ELSE
           DISPLAY error message "Please fill in all fields."
       ENDIF
   ENDIF
END
